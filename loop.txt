loop (repeatation)
--------------------------------------
when our program has code which run multiple times, we should use loop. 
loop execute some line of code until some condition become false 
loop has mainly two part. 
    condition
    body of the loop 

there are two types of loop 
    entry control loop 
        in this type of loop condition is checked first, if condition is true then body of loop execute. condition and body of loop execute until condition is false 
    exit control loop 
        in this type of loop, body of the loop execute then after condition is checked. body of loop and condition execute until condition is false.

c language has 3 loops
    1) while loop (entry control loop)
    2) for loop  (entry control loop)
    3) do while loop (exit control loop)
